ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Exam Gym Workspace!

## What is this ?

This is an initiative that strictly goes against the commercialization of education sector, that has become a money cow by few business giants. The education sector has sadly transformed into an industry, which essentially gets tens of lakhs of customers every year.

As the above has happened, it has become almost impossible for students belonging to the marginalized, less fortunate and financially weak sections of the society to cope up with the ever increasing competition and vast syllabus (that inturn was a response to the actions of the coaching industry as the papers became predictable).

What's more saddening is that the Engineering preparation in India has become a constant source of depression, hardship and sacrifice for students and a recurring money fountain for coaching centres that charge lakhs of rupees as fees. Apparently there are cities that are nothing but collection of coaching institutes and paying guest houses. There is absolutely no way someone with all these resources can compete.

## Our Plans

We would be shortly publishing our detailed plans and road-map so that potential contributors can get an idea what to expect from the project.

At this point, all we can say is that our main tech stack would be javascript,and we would we creating servers, user interfaces, desktop applications, bots and browser extensions.

## What we are not

We completely understand that seeking avenues of business and expansion is a natural human trait, and there are numerous reasons that coaching centres charge lakhs of rupees (such as maintaining the infrastructure, hiring faculty, study material etc). But this in no ways can justify the tilted balance of the education system, that has left the less fortunate on their own, especially if they do not belong to the un-reserved category.

## How to join us

The main channel of communication would be Discord and collaboration would be Github. If you are not very familiar with them, then don't worry, we would be happy to help you. There is no formal acceptance or hiring process, all contributions to the projects, of all forms are welcomed.
If you are willing to start off in open source, then we strongly recommend in taking leadership roles, as we are looking forward for as much distribution of power and responsibility to give a sense of belonging in the project.

## Suggestions

We are ever open to suggestions which are constructive. Feel free to reach out on discord if you have any.
